* Baking Rasberry Pi OS
** The OK01

The vital part, the ACT is now wired to the GPIO 47, and it's enabled by a 1,
not 0 written on the tutorial.

There are 54 pins on the Rasberry Pi, and there are few bytes in charge of the
functions of those pins, that is the function controller. Anyway, the
controller has 24 bytes in all, each 4 bytes(32 bits) is conressponding to at
most 10 pins.
